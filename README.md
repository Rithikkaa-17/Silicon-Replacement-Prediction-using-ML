Silicon Replacement Prediction Using Machine Learning

WEBSITE: https://rithikkaasjmlproject.netlify.app/

Overview:
This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to predict alternative materials for silicon-based semiconductor applications. By leveraging material properties and advanced ML models, we aim to identify potential replacements that optimize performance, efficiency, and sustainability in semiconductor technology.

Objectives:
Develop an ML-based framework to analyze and predict suitable silicon alternatives.
Utilize material science datasets to train predictive models.
Compare different supervised learning algorithms for accuracy and interpretability.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Models Implemented: Random Forest

Approach:
Data Collection & Processing – Compiled a dataset of material properties relevant to semiconductor applications.
Feature Engineering & Selection – Applied dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA) and feature importance analysis.
Model Training & Evaluation – Trained and tested multiple ML models using cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and performance metrics like RMSE, R² Score, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Predictions & Insights – Identified promising silicon alternatives and assessed their feasibility for real-world applications.

Results:
The materials K₂TiS₃, KGeCl₃, Li₅TiN₃, Mg₃BN₃, and Na₅SiP₃ show some potential to replace silicon in specific areas of solar cell applications from the data set given to us, but they do not fully surpass silicon’s dominance.

Future Work:
Expanding the dataset with experimental validation and real-world data.
Building an interactive web dashboard for material exploration.
